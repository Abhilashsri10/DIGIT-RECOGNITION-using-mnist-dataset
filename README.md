# DIGIT-RECOGNITION-using-mnist-dataset
recognizing handwritten numerical digit (from 0-9) using mnist dataset and SGD to train the simple two layer deep NN model. 
the mnist datasets has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples of 28*28 pixel image sets.
It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST.
